# tgmlib
This project contains a number of utilities for working with .TGM map files for the game Kohan: Ahriman's Gift. It is under active development, so expect both feature and interface changes.
This project has external dependencies, you can find them here: https://github.com/tim-de/tgrlib/releases

Currently, the two utilities are map updating and map mirroring
