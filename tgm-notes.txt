FORM chunk
	4 bytes big-endian: size of file not including FORM
	TGSV (time gate save)
HEDR chunk
	standard 4byte chunk length
	followed by 8 bytes
GVER chunk
	standard 4byte chunk length
	Compatible game versions
	Switched for settings toggles (which zones to display, etc) However, they don't seem to do anything. When zeroed, the map will load and the game will repopulate it when saved.
EDTR chunk:
	standard 4byte chunk length
	0x60 for KAG maps, 0x50 for KIS, followed by 0x000000
	1 byte storing name length
	name_length bytes containing the map name. 0x85 is the red circle, 0x86 is the crossed swords, 0x8B is sword & shield
	1 byte storing description length
	description
	1 byte defines a kingdom's faction:
		0x01 is Nationalist
		0x02 is Royalist
		0x03 is Council
		0x04 is Ceyah
MPST chunk:
	short, but significant differences after making any changes

MGRD chunk:
	Very large, appears to contain the data for rendering the minimap. It's size is map_width*map_height*2 + 4
	Rows run NE to SW, starting at the northern-most tile. Each subsequent row will be to the SE of the previous one. Note that the outer ring of tile that cannot have features placed on them ARE included in the map dimensions.
	Different terrain have a code like 22 or EE; if it is blended with grass, it will be 02 or 0E
	Terrain Codes:
	00 :	Grass
	33 :	Beach
	22 :	Corrupt
	55 :	Desert
	EE :	Evil
	66 :	Forest
	FF :	Forest2
	77 :	Hills
	44 :	Jungle
	CC :	Mountain
	11 :	Rough
	88 :	Snow
	99 :	snow Forest
	AA :	Snow Mountain
	BB :	Water
	
	Note all tiles rotated so that north is in the upper left

	Color codes (these do NOT correspond to rgb565 colors):
	0x0010 is grass
	0x0332 is beach
	0x0030 is map edge
	0x0070 is mountain

RADR chunk:
	only contains 4 bytes of data, even in save-games

FTRS chunk:
	Contains a list of "features", with each entry being 0x10 bytes long, and padded with 0x092F. The first byte is 0x10, likely signifying the length.

FIDX chunk:
	very short

CMPG chunk:
	Seems to always be 0x 0000 0000 0000 0000

TECH chunk:
	Contains the known techs of each player.

GAME chunk:
	chunk is always 69712 bytes in KAG maps, regardless of map dimensions. Seems to be 4 bytes shorter in KIS maps.
SIM  chunk:

MMGR chunk:


TYPE chunk:
	Holds a list of every single graphical object loaded. There are 5 versions of every hero, 2 of every structure or unit, and 1 of every feature or projectile. This corresponds to the object cap overhead for the given object type.
	4byte chunk size, followed by 0x0100, then the number of objects loaded, in a little-endian short
	Each entry is 34 bytes long the last 2(?) of which seem to demark what type of object it is

	Terrain is 0x0002
	Lairs:
		DRAGON_LAIR:		0x0303
		DRAGON_LAIR ruin:	0x0202 (potentially all ruined structures: confirmed)
	Units:
		Spellcaster:	0x0101
		Regular:		0x0001
		
	Corpses are 0x0102
	Heroes are 0x0201
	Hero Corpses are 0x0402

	Effects:
		Dragon_Breath:	0x0705

HROS chunk
	first 4 bytes are a big-endian chunk length, starting at the next byte
	There are 4 more bytes before the individual hero entries start
	Each hero entry consists of a byte encoding the length of their their INI filename, followed by the filename, followed by 26 bytes. They appear to always be 18 null bytes, 4 ones bytes, and 4 more null bytes.

PLRS chunk
	first 4 bytes are a big-endian chunk length, starting at the next byte
	Contains sections for each player slot, as well as independent
	Each player is 4597 bytes long, and starts with the player name, if one is assigned. Otherwise it will be Player N

OBJS chunk:
	contains a list of all the structures and companies on the map and their associated data
